# HONK BOT

This bot posts HONK and a random flickr photo of a goose whenever someone posts /honk (case insensitive)

Since it uses the flickr API, you need to: 
- get an API key from them [here](https://www.flickr.com/services/api/misc.api_keys.html)
- create a `.env` file containing the line `export FLICKR_KEY=<YOUR FLICKR KEY>`
